# WhatThePrivacyPolicy
What The?! (Game) User Privacy Policy

# WE DO NOT COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION. 

The **WhatThe?!** development, owned by GoliathEC pty ltd, does not collect personal information from its users. Only data collected are purely for game-play analytics (e.g. how much a certain deck is played). No identifiable information will accompany this data.

## Camera Permission

If 'record video' is enabled (through settings menu), which is defaulted to disabled, then *during game play only*, we will use camera information to produce a video of audience (player) participation during that round. 

Camera is inactive if not in 'game-state'.

## Folder (file reading/writing) permission

We use this permission to save any in-game recordings from a particular round. The user is given a choice in whether a video will be saved to their device. 

## Audio Recording Permission

If 'record video' is enabled (through settings menu), which is defaulted to disabled, then *during game play only*, we will use audio (from your device microphone) to produce a video of audience (player) participation during that round.
